<p>Specializing in a functional and comprehensive

approach to diagnose, treat & rehabilitate musculoskeletal impairments</p>
<p>My approach is aimed at identifying and treating the root cause of the pain and in turn relieving symptoms and preventing further injury. Muscles and Joints form a complex interconnected web. Tightness or weakness in any area of the body can affect the way we move and perform.</p>

<p>If left untreated these factors can lead to further problems elsewhere in the body.</p>

<p>Each client we see will have a unique injury or issue, treatment will be tailored to their needs. This will usually involve a combination of the therapies.
